# GuessTheMovie

## Description
GuessTheMovie is a Python game that challenges players to identify popular Bollywood movie dialogues and guess the corresponding movie titles. With a collection of iconic dialogues from classic Bollywood films, this game offers entertainment and nostalgia for movie enthusiasts. Developed as one of my earliest Python projects, GuessTheMovie holds a special place in my heart as one of the first games I created while learning Python. Even as I continue to refine my programming skills, I still enjoy playing this game with friends, reminiscing about our favorite Bollywood movies.
